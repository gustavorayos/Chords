# Shellchords
Give it a root note, then choose whether it's a major or minor, and Shellchords will help you start that masterpiece. Scales and chords go hand in hand. They are an algorithm, a pattern. I just wanted a simple tool to help me see what chords fit in specific scales, and the diatonic triads of the chords.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Unix based system with bash v4 or above installed (tested on MacBook with latest Bash installed through homebrew) OR
* Windows based system

### Installing

* Copy .sh script to system and double click, or run on terminal. OR
* Copy .ps1 script to system and right click and select run in Powershell. OR
* Copy .exe file to Windows system and double click.

## Notes

On Mac OS, you won't be able to run this using the default bash that is installed Mac OS X. You'll need to install bash v4 to be able to run it. This can be done using homebrew, and you'll also have to add the correct location of where bash is located (Ex. #!/opt/homebrew/Cellar/bash/5.3.3/bin/bash).
